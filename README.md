This project is built using pure HTML and it is perfect for learning, practicing, and preparing for interviews.

I built a pure HTML project that serves as a learning and resource hub for HTML beginners and job seekers. The main page features a curated list of HTML interview questions and answers. From there, users can navigate to a projects page that showcases four mini-projects: a personal portfolio, a blog page, a job application form, and a product landing page. Each project has a live preview and a download option.

I also created a resources page that offers downloadable PDFs for each project, along with additional learning materials like an HTML roadmap, tag references, and practice questions. The entire project is structured with seven HTML pages and is designed to be simple, educational, and easy to navigate perfect for self-learners.
